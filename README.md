In my second mini Game it's about surviving the dangerous animals which are trying to stomp into the ground, all this with a Top-Down view.
The animals have Healthbars and can spawn on three different points on the vertical axis.
The Player can move with "WASD" to avoid the charging wildlife. As his weapon the player shots Bones with the "Spacebar"

The difficulty increases over time until they spawn every Second 

Enjoy!
